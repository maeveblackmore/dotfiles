# Dotfiles

These are my personal configuration files for macOS and various applications. It largely consists of terminal applications, which should generally all be cross-platform, especially in the Unix space.
- [Helix](https://helix-editor.com) — text editor
- [fish](https://fishshell.com) — command-line shell
- [Starship](https://starship.rs) — cross-shell prompt
- [kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) — terminal emulator

On macOS, I use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install and manage packages where I can.
